# README-Generator

Challenge Assignment: README Generator in the command line, using node.js

## Description

This challenge assignment was meant to allow us to demonstrate some proficiency and comprehension of the following topics: 
- node.js
- command-line apps
- using the Terminal
- professional README guidelines

The app is meant to allow busy developers quickly and easily generate a README file for their work, directly from the command-line terminal.  This would save them time and effort, especially as the markdown formatting is already incorporated into the app.  

I learned to use node.js, built familiarity with the command-line terminal, and how to generate files that incorporate user input.

## Installation

node.js and inquirer packages are required for this app.  We used v16 for node.js and v8 for inquirer.

## Usage

To use the README Generator app, open the index.js file in your preferred coding text editor. We prefer Visual Studio Code.  Open the file in your integrated Terminal and run the command "node index.js".  You should then be prompted with the relevant questions.  Your answers will be recorded and displayed in the subsequently generated .md file (named after your input for your app name).  Then, find the file in the ./output folder and use it however your app requires.
